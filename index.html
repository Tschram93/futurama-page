        <h1 id="rounded-border">And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</h1>
            <p>Tell her she looks thin. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. And then the battle's not so bad?</p>
            <p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? A sexy mistake. Who are those horrible orange men? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity  who isn't bound and gagged.</p>


        <div class="flexbox-container">
        
        <div class="flexbox-item-1">    <h2 >I just told you! You've killed me!</h2>
                <p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Why did you bring us here? It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>So, how 'bout them Knicks?</li>
                    <li>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</li>
                    <li>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</li>
                </ol>

        <div class="flexbox-item-2">    <h3>Is that a cooking show?</h3>
                <p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. You are the last hope of the universe. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhhâ€¦ also, comes with double prize money.</li>
                    <li>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</li>
                    <li>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</li>
